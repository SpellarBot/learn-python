# CPython

**Python** is a language. **CPython** is the implementation of **Python** in **C**. **Jython** is the implementation in **Java**, and so on. To sum up: You are already using CPython (if you downloaded from Python.org).

## So what is CPython?

CPython is the original Python implementation. It is the implementation you download from Python.org. People call it CPython to distinguish it from other, later, Python implementations, and to distinguish the implementation of the language engine from the Python programming language itself.

## What about Jython, etc.?

**Jython**, **IronPython** and **PyPy** are the current "other" implementations of the Python programming language; these are implemented in **Java**, **C#** and **RPython** (a subset of Python), respectively. **Jython** compiles your Python code to Java bytecode, so your Python code can run on the JVM. **IronPython** lets you run Python on the Microsoft CLR. And **PyPy**, being implemented in (a subset of) Python, lets you run Python code faster than CPython, which rightly should blow your mind. :-)

# First Class Functions In Python

"**First-Class Functions**" (**FCF**) are functions which are treated as so called "**First-Class Citizens**" (**FCC**). FCC's in a programming language are **objects** which:

- Can be used as **parameters**
- Can be used as **a return value**
- Can **be assigned to variables**
- Can **be stored in data structures** such as hash tables, lists, ...

Actually, very roughly and simply put, **FCF's are variables of the type 'function'** (or variables which point to a function). You can do with them everything you can do with **a 'normal' variable**.

**First class functions**: If a function can **be assigned to a variable** or **passed as object/variable to other function**, that function is called as **first class function**.

`Python`, `JavaScript` and `C`(pointers) support **first class functions**.


The notion of "**first-class citizen**" in a programming language was introduced by British computer scientist **Christopher Strachey** in the 1960s in the context of **first-class functions**. The most famous formulation of this principle is probably in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Gerald Jay Sussman and Harry Abelson:

- They may be named by variables.
- They may be passed as arguments to procedures.
- They may be returned as the results of procedures.
- They may be included in data structures.

Basically, it means that you can do with **this programming language element** everything that you can do with **all other elements** in the programming language.

## Second-class citizen

A second-class citizen is a person who is systematically discriminated against within a state or other political jurisdiction, despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there.

# Generator

## Generator 1

- A generator is a function that produces **a sequence of results** instead of a single value.

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

for i in countdown(5):
    print(i)
```

- Instead of returning a value, you generate a series of values (using the `yield` statement).
- Typically, you hook it up to a for-loop

## Generator 2

- Behavior is quite different than normal func
- Calling a generator function creates an generator object. However, it does **not** start running the function.

```python
def countdown(n):
    print("Counting down from", n)
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

x = countdown(10)
print(x)    # <generator object countdown at 0x7fd1a6915518>
```

## Generator Functions

- The function only executes  on `__next__()` 

```python
def countdown(n):
    print("Counting down from", n)
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

x = countdown(10)
print(x)
print(x.__next__())
print(next(x))
```

- `yield` produces a value, but suspends the function
- Function resumes on next call to `__next__()` or `next(variable_name)`
- When the generator returns, iteration stops

## Example: A Python version of Unix 'tail -f'

```python
# write.py
import time

if __name__ == '__main__':
    count = 0
    with open("access_log.txt","ab") as f:
        while True:
            if count % 3 == 0:
                line = "Hello world, {}\r\n".format(time.time())
            else:
                line = "python, {}\r\n".format(time.time())
            count += 1
            time.sleep(1)
            data = line.encode("utf8")
            f.write(data)
            f.flush()

```

```python
# follow.py
import time
def follow(the_file):
    the_file.seek(0, 2)    # Go to the end of the file
    while True:
        line = the_file.readline()
        if not line:
            time.sleep(1)    # Sleep briefly
            continue
        yield line

if __name__ == '__main__':
    log_file = open("access_log.txt")
    for line in follow(log_file):
        print(line)

```

## Generators as Pipelines

- One of the most powerful applications of generators is setting up processing pipelines
- Similar to shell pipes in Unix
```
input sequence --> generator --> generator --> generator --> for x in s:
```
- Idea: You can stack a series of generator functions together into a pipe and pull items through it with a for-loop

## Example: A Pipeline

```python
# pipeline.py
import time

def follow(the_file):
    the_file.seek(0, 2)
    while True:
        line = the_file.readline()
        if not line:
            time.sleep(1)
            continue
        yield line
    
def grep(pattern, lines):
    for line in lines:
        if pattern in line:
            yield line

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Set up a processing pipe: tail -f | grep python
    log_file = open("access_log.txt")
    log_lines = follow(log_file)
    pylines = grep("python", log_lines)
    
    # Pull requests out of the processing pipeline
    for line in pylines:
        print(line)

```

## Yield as a Expression

- You could now use `yield` as an exression.

```python
def grep(pattern):
    print("Looking for %s" % pattern)
    while True:
        line = (yield)
        if pattern in line:
            print(line)

```

- Question: What is its value?

## Coroutine

- If you use `yield` more generally, you get a coroutine
- These do more than just generate values
- Instead, functions can consume values **sent** to it.

```python
def grep(pattern):
    print("Looking for %s" % pattern)
    while True:
        line = (yield)
        if pattern in line:
            print(line)
        else:
            print("Not")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    g = grep("python")
    g.__next__()    # Prime it
    g.send("Yeah, but no, but yeah, but no")
    g.send("A series of tubes")
    g.send("python generators rock!")
```

- Sent values are returned by `(yield)`

## Coroutine Execution

- Execution is the same as for a generator
- When you call a coroutine, nothing happens
- They only run in response to `__next__()` and `send()` methods

```python
g = grep("python")    # Notice that no output was produced
g.__next__()          # On first operation, coroutine starts running
```

## Coroutine Priming

Ôºç All coroutines must be "primed" by first calling `.__next__()` (or `send(None)`)
- This advances execution to the location of the first `yield` expression.
```python
def grep(pattern):
    print("Looking for %s" % pattern)
    while True:
        line = (yield)    # .__next__() advances the coroutine to the first yield expression
        if pattern in line:
            print(line)
```
- At this point, it's ready to receive a value

## Using a Decorator

- Remembering to call `.__next__()` is easy to forget
- Solved by wrapping coroutines with a decorator

```python
def coroutine(func):
    def start(*args, **kwargs):
        cr = func(*args, **kwargs)
        cr.__next__()
        return cr
    return start

@coroutine
def grep(pattern):
    ...

```

# Writing idiomatic python

## Control Flow And Function

But at a deeper level, the reasoning is based on the difference between **equality** and **identity** . Using `==` determines if two objects **have the same value** (as defined by their `_eq` attribute). Using `is` determines if the two objects are **actually the same object**.

Note the use of `is not` : comparisons against `None` (a singleton in Python) should always use `is` or `is not` , not `==` (from PEP8).

bytes:
bool: Flase
object: None
int(number): 0
tutple: ()
dict: {}
list: []


One of the lesser known facts about Pythonâ€™s `for` loop is that it can include an `else` clause. The `else` clause is executed after the iterator is exhausted, unless the loop was ended prematurely due to a `break` statement.

## Working with data

### List: list comprehensions

Bad Code:

```python
num_list = range(10)
prime_num_list = list()
for num in num_list:
    if is_prime(num):
        prime_num_list.append(num)
```

Good Code:

```python
num_list = range(10)
some_list = [
    num + 5
    for num in num_list
    if is_prime(num)
]
```

Full Code:

```python
